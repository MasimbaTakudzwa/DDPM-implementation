# DDPM-implementation
A 3rd year undergraduate implementation of the DDPM paper. In this implementation there are still bugs in the architecture which must be fixed to allow for propper diffusion model training. This implementation was based on the paper written by Ho et al. 2020


Abstract
Diffusion probabilistic models are a part of a family of deep generative models that are used to synthesise high quality images. This paper details an
attempt to implement this type of generative model to synthesise high quality images. This class of generative models were inspired by considerations
of non equilibrium thermodynamics. 

A draft of the final paper is availble in the github repo
